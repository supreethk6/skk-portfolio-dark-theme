                I've had the pleasure of working with Supreeth when I was consulting one of our early Transitive Robotics customers. I found Supreeth to be a true generalist: a competent people manager, a solid robotics engineer, and all along a real self-starter that works extremely hard, always maintaining a high degree of professionalism. As such, Supreeth can play many roles, incl. as an IC or player coach. He is always eager to learn, ambitious, and an effective team-player.

                As a robotics engineer, Supreeth brings a rich set of skill set that is valuable to a team tasked to implement novel features. His efforts were instrumental in implementing several key features that improved performance at reduced cost. He also effectively managed an off-shore team. He is a team player and I would recommend him to any organization.

                Supreeth, was a Robot Fleet Engineer at Knightscope reporting to me. He was very dedicated, passionate and hardworking. He always had the "gotta get it done however long it takes" attitude! He kept his work organized and meticulously tracked deliverables. Supreeth is fun to work with, and will be a hard-worker anywhere he goes!

                Supreeth has been working with me for two semesters on robotics, especially robotic 3D printing. During the project, he has demonstrated good coding skills in ROS and solid knowledge and hands-on skills in mechatronics. He worked on both mobile robots (iRobot) and robotic arms (UR10e). He is very diligent and learns things quickly. He has good communication skills also. Overall, I think he will become a very good robotics engineer if given chances to work on real-world robotics problems/platforms.
